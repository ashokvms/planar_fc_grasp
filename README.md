    * Force Closure Grasp Metrics
  * Planar Surfaces
    * Trianlgle, Rectangle, Circle
  * Code Restructring
    * Create separate module for surfaces: Different classes for each surface type with functions for surface creation, contact point selection and contact normals
    * Create separate module for grasp analysis: Different classes for grasp anaysis and helper tools
    * Make the current script as just generic example to show usage of functions
    * Make new script to take different command line arguments (surface type, friction coeefficient, number of points, contact locations, contact forces) and perform grasp analysis
